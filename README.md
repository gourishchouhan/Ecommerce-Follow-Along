# Ecommerce Follow Along

## Project Description

**Ecommerce Follow Along** is a hands-on project designed to guide participants through the process of building a full-fledged e-commerce application from scratch using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project aims to provide practical experience with real-world development concepts and tools, enabling developers to create scalable and efficient web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this milestone, we focused on the foundational aspects of the e-commerce application. The session was mentor-led, providing insights into the overall vision, goals, and key features of the project. Hereâ€™s a summary of what was covered:

- **Understanding the MERN Stack:** 
  - The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications. It allows developers to use JavaScript across both the front-end and back-end, streamlining the development process.

- **REST API Structure and Endpoints:** 
  - We discussed the architecture of REST APIs, which facilitate communication between the client and server using standard HTTP methods. Key API endpoints will include:
    - **User Authentication:** Registering and logging in users.
    - **Product Management:** Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
    - **Order Handling:** Managing customer orders.

- **Basics of Database Schema Design:** 
  - We explored how to define the structure and relationships of data stored in MongoDB, which is crucial for effective data management.

- **Role of Authentication in Web Applications:** 
  - We emphasized the importance of user authentication, which verifies the identity of users before granting access to sensitive resources, such as making purchases.

## Milestone 2: Structuring 

- **Project Structure**
  - **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS (Login Page)
  - **Backend**: Node.js + Express

- **Features Implemented**
  - **Project Setup**: Created structured folder hierarchy for frontend and backend.  
  - **Frontend Setup**: Initialized a React app using Vite.  
  - **Backend Setup**: Set up a simple Node.js Express server.  
  - **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Configured Tailwind CSS for styling.  
  - **Login Page**: Designed and developed a functional, styled login page.  

## Milestone 3: Backend Setup
  - Organized backend folders into a structured format.
  - Configured an Express server.
  - Connected the server to MongoDB using Mongoose.
  - Implemented basic error handling for better debugging.

## Milestone 4: User Model, Controller, and File Uploads

### Features Implemented:
- Created a User model using Mongoose
- Developed a User Controller for user registration and retrieval
- Configured Multer to handle file uploads
- Set up API routes for user-related operations

### API Endpoints:
1. **POST /api/users/register** - Register a new user (with profile picture)
2. **GET /api/users/:id** - Get user details by ID
